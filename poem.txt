Where are you taking us, madam?
the crew needed to know;
but since by the final night
my guiding star,
instinct and purpose both, had strayed so far
off the monitor – I found I couldn’t stay
for fear of the answer.
ok
To tell the truth
I had given up on youth; would only stew
in the chemical toilet, the door half-
open, a ‘cry for help’, till out of the blue
a nurse ducked
from the cockpit holding you, and I
was face to face with my pilot!
